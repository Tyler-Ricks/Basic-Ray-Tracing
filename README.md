This is a basic raytracer that is almost entirely just the one from the raytracing in one weekend series here: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

My goals here are just to learn more about materials and light, as well as some graphics techniques that I can mess around with later. After finishing the first chapter, I 
did a whole bunch of renders on my own. They ended up utilizing my own stuff and it was a lot of fun. (you can find PPM files for these in the out folder) I also decided to 
keep working on this by following the next chapter in this raytracing series.

I've finished the second book, done a bunch of renders, and added some of my own features now. Progress will be a lot slower now, but I'll continue to add some things that
I find interesting
